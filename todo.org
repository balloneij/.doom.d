#+TITLE: Todo

* DONE Why can't I add .doom.d to a project
Vertico is buggy as of <2021-12-17 Fri>
* DONE Remove old projects in =SPC p p=
* DONE Remove new headings in file search buffers
Reverted back to Ivy which does not add headings to search buffers
* TODO Get dap-cpptools and try debugging rust
* TODO Allow C-u, C-d, C-f, C-b in swiper
Mimic vim behavior
* TODO In normal mode, map backspace to the previous buffer
If the last buffer was in the same window, use =previous-buffer=, if
the last buffer was in a different window, switch to that frame, if
it was in a different frame, switch to that frame+window
**
* TODO In normal mode, when using left or right arrow, navigate last ivy session
Shortcut to =ivy-resume=. It should probably display a message
when there's no results besides the one, and it shouldn't wrap around
** TODO Pressing =<-= is equivalanet to =SPC '=, =C-k=, =ENTER=
** TODO Pressing =->= is equivalanet to =SPC '=, =C-j=, =ENTER=
** TODO At the top of an Ivy session, =<-= displays a message "No prior results"
** TODO At the bottom of an Ivy session, =->= displays a message "No more results"
** TODO If the list count is 1, it should be the equivalent of =SPC '=, =ENTER=
** TODO If the list count is 1, it should also display "Only one result"
** TODO If the list count is 0, it should display "No results"
** TODO If there is no Ivy session, it should display "No session results"
* TODO In Rust, define a hot key that jumps to the nearest mod file
* TODO In Rust, define a delete inner |
[[file:config.el::;; TODO Evil inner pipe binding][In progress]]. Stumped :/
* DONE Switch =SPC-;= and =SPC-:=
* DONE Disable super save
* DONE On build, save all modified project files
Customized specifically for Rustic =(buffer-save-without-query t)=
